Udacity Front End Nanodegree Arcade Game

## Getting Started

To play the game, open the index.html file in any modern browser window.

Use the arrow keys [up, down, left, right] to move your character around the screen.
The goal is to reach the river at the top of the screen without being ran over by the giant bugs racing across the screen.
If a bug runs you over, you will be reset to your original starting position.
A game-winning modal window will pop up to congratulate you when you have won the game.

To play again after winning, close the modal window and refresh the page in the browser to reset everything.
Have fun!


### Dependencies

Bootstrap CSS, jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap javascript plugins are used in the game winning modal.
